Medieval jousting was a martial game or tournament between two knights mounted on horses and armed with lances. It was a popular form of entertainment and a way to resolve conflicts without the need for a full battle, showcasing the skill, bravery, and chivalry of the participating knights. The process of medieval jousting evolved over time, but generally involved the following stages:

## Tournament Announcement and Participation: 
Jousting tournaments were announced well in advance, allowing knights from various regions to participate. These events were significant social occasions, attracting not just knights but also large audiences, including nobles and royals. Knights would enter the tournament by invitation or by meeting certain criteria, such as lineage or valor.

## Preparation and Equipment: 
Knights would prepare for the joust by donning their armor, which was specifically designed for protection in the joust. This included a helmet (often with a visor), a breastplate, gauntlets, and leg guards. Their horses were also equipped with protective gear. The lance used in jousting was typically long and wooden, designed to break upon impact to absorb some of the shock and reduce injuries.

## The Jousting Event: 
The core of the jousting tournament was the individual matches between knights. Each knight would mount their horse at opposite ends of the list (the designated area for the joust), which was often divided by a barrier to prevent the horses from colliding. At the signal, both knights would gallop towards each other and attempt to strike their opponent with the lance, aiming for the shield or the torso to score points or achieve a knockdown.

## Scoring and Victory: 
The rules and methods of scoring in jousting varied over time and by region. Points could be awarded for breaking a lance on the opponent's body, for unseating the opponent, or for striking a particularly difficult target. The victor of a match was typically the knight who scored the most points, with the ultimate champion of the tournament being the knight who won the most matches.

## Chivalry and Conduct: 
Beyond the physical competition, jousting tournaments were governed by codes of chivalry and conduct. Knights were expected to show courage, honor, and respect towards their opponents and the audience. The ideals of knighthood, such as valor, skill, and courtesy, were as important as the physical outcome of the joust.

## Festivities and Rewards: 
Tournaments were not only about the joust; they included feasts, dances, and other forms of entertainment. Victorious knights were rewarded with prizes, which could include money, land, or titles, in addition to honor and recognition. These rewards, along with the prestige associated with success in tournaments, motivated knights to participate.

Medieval jousting played a significant role in the social and military culture of the Middle Ages. It provided a way for knights to train for combat, resolve disputes, and display their martial skills and bravery, all within the framework of the chivalric code that valued honor, loyalty, and prowess.
